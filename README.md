# Pitch Vertice Graph (Improved Tonnetz)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilis/pitch-node-graph/illustration.png" align="right" title="illustration">
_An improved [Tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz) layout._

##  How to use

1.  Print a sheet PDF.
2.  Draw the graph _edges_ for your chords.

I suggest drawing lines, not areas. Connect the pitches in the thirds and skip connecting the fifths.

##  How it is constructed

Fifths (P5) are upwards, Major thirds (M3) are to the top right, minor thirds (m3) – to the top left.

Minor seconds (m2, half-tones) are located further left and right from the reference vertice.

The distance of M3 and m3 intervals differs slightly.

##  Advantages

Compared to the most widespread Tonnetz examples:

- No pre-printed edges makes _your_ drawings clearer.

- Pitches increase consistently from bottom to top and are easier to copmare visually:

    - Easier to compare relative pitch differences (esp. in the case of **S** (_Slide_) [triadic transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory#Triadic_transformations_and_voice_leading)).

    - Easier to recognize and understand the [triadic transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory#Triadic_transformations_and_voice_leading).

    - **E** is now _higher_ than **E♭**

    - No confusion over why _augmented_ goes downwards while _diminished_ goes upwards (they now point right and left).

- No inverted colors to improve readability.
